                                                        some drawbacks to consider when using
                                                        SideProjectors. Firstly, due to its popularity, the marketplace
                                                        can become crowded with listings, making it
                                                        challenging for individual projects to stand out. This can make
                                                        it difficult for sellers to attract the
                                                        attention of potential buyers and may require additional effort
                                                        in marketing and promoting their

                                                        lack of a formal vetting process for
                                                        listed projects. While SideProjectors provides a platform for
                                                        sellers to showcase their ventures, it does

                                                        startups. However, the crowded nature of the marketplace and the
                                                        absence of a formal vetting process are
